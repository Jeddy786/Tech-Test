# iConvert Technical Test

## 

Welcome to the iConvert Technical Test!

## Technology Choices

The reason I have chosen the following technologies is because the current experience I have using them and thought it would be good for demonstration purposes.  

## How To Run

To run this project I used XAMPP for both the project as well the database which was MYSQL.

## Once Running

The campaign search page returns a campaign as a JSON file in the JSON folder. 

## Attachments

I have attached an SQL file which contains the two tables used alongside this project.

The tables have been exported from a database called iconvert in MYSQL.

## Future Ammendments

If I had more time I would have added the following functionality:

* Forgot Password.
* Add Unit/Functional/Integration Testing.
